&#8226; Use Generate Code to create event functions, with parameters
&#8226; Auto-suggest event functions completion when creating methods
&#8226; Code completion, find usages and rename support for Invoke, InvokeRepeating and CancelInvoke
&#8226; Event function descriptions for methods and parameters displayed in tooltips and QuickDoc
&#8226; "Read more" in QuickDoc navigates to Unity API documentation
